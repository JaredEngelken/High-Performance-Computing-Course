# High-Performance-Computing-Course

This course at the University of Freiburg was inteded to give an introduction to high-performance computing through the implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method for a sliding-lid problem in Python. The final code was created through a series of milestones, ending in a parallelizable fluid simulation program that can be run on any parallel system, such as the bwUniCluster in Karlsruhe, Germany.

All code was written by Jared Engelken with inspiration and assisstance from the lectures and works of Andreas Greiner, Jan Mees, and Lars Pastewka.

Code is categorically named by its associated milestone and the progress iteration:

1: Streaming Operator

2: Collision Operator

3: Shear Wave Decay Simulation

4: Couette Flow Simulation

5: Poiseulle Flow Simulation

6: Sliding-Lid Simulation

7: Parallelization of the Sliding-Lid Simulation
